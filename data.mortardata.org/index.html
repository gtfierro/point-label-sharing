                    <p>
                    Semantic metadata standards for buildings such as <a href="https://brickschema.org">Brick</a> and <a href="https://project-haystack.org/">Project Haystack</a> show promise
                    in enablilng wide-scale deployment of energy-efficiency measures and advanced building management technologies. Converting existing building metadata to these standard forms
                    is an area of active research.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The data available here is a collection of metadata pulled from real building management systems around the world. By making this data available, we hope to facilitate research
                    into the automated conversion of unstructured metadata into standard forms.
                    The dataset currently contains attributes for <b>103,064 points</b> from <b>92 buildings</b>.

                    <h2>Mortar Testbed</h2>

                    <p>
                    Access to large amounts of real-world data has long been a barrier to the development and evaluation of analytics applications for the built environment. Open data sets exist, but they are limited in their <u>span</u> (how much data is available) and <u>context</u> (what kind of data is available and how it is described).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The goal of Mortar is to provide a large, diverse and consistently updated testbed of buildings and building data to facilitate reproducible evaluation of building analytics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    At this time, Mortar contains <b>107 buildings</b>, spanning over <b>10 billion data points</b> and <b>26,000 data streams</b>. Context for these data streams  is provided by a <a href="https://brickschema.org/">Brick model</a>. The Brick model describes for each building: (1) what data streams exist and what they measure, (2) what equipment exists and how it is monitored, (3) the relationships between equipment in terms of flows, composition and location.
